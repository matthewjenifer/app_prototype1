how can we update bass note extraction to recognize the following chords as minor?:

Ami7
Dmi7
Cmi11
Cmi9
Cmi6/9
Dmi7(b5)
Bbmi7(b5)



... in other words, when 'mi' is found in the base note extraction it should treat that value as a minor key/chord

'Bbmi7(b5)' should register as 'Bbmi'
'Dmi7(b5)' should register as 'Dmi'
'Cmi6/9' should register as 'Cmi'
